# Desolate Hangar
Empty and devoid of humans. Only some automatic messages and beat-up robots inhabit the forgotten hangar. 
It is not clear if the phantoms that haunt it are artifacts of your augmented reality implants or if they originate from
some other power.
## Technical Background
Desolate Hangar is planned and designed to be as minimalistic as possible to accomodate the simple feature set of the current engine.
## Play time
While it should play out in about 2 minutes for very experienced players. The challenges of the map should stretch play time to about 10 minutes for the average player.
## Gameplay Elements
### Platforming
Platforming is a major part of this map
### Teleportation
Teleportation will be used at some parts of this map however it will take a back seat to the platforming since the feature is not mature yet.
### Phantoms
Phantoms don't do anything at this iteration of the game. They probably can only be heard at certain points of the map.
